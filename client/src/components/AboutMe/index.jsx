        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>My name is Anthony Purificato and I am a developer.</h3>
        <p>My current specialty is Front-End Development with a focus on the following technologies: HTML, CSS (and CSS Frameworks), and JavaScript (including React). I have worked on a variety of projects, including building websites and applications. Although my current specialty is Front-End, I have some additional knowledge and experience working with Back-End technologies, including Node.js, SQL (PostgreSQL), NoSQL (MongoDB), and Express.js.</p>
        <p>I have recently completed a Full Stack Coding Bootcamp through Rutgers University, which has helped bridge the gap from my previous web experience. Before this, I had worked at a Web Agency for about 3 years, learning some of the ins and outs of websites and publishing on websites through various platforms. I completed projects both small and large in scale and became proficient in WordPress, MailChimp, Campaign Monitor, and other tools used for building websites/landing pages and email marketing campaigns.</p>
        <p>I have a passion for building websites and seeing my work completed throughout the entire process, from start to finish. I continue to grow and learn new things everyday!</p>
